Ok so here are the fixes I think we need to get an mvp out: 
-stays logged in (it logs out when app refreshes..)
-text stays down when responding (it goes up and off screen when you start typing a response, I think I showed you at the first meetup)
-can actually respond
-sync contacts
I can clarify anything that I didn't explain well. Just gimme a call. Keep a pic of a Lambo on your phone and we'll use it as fuel!
